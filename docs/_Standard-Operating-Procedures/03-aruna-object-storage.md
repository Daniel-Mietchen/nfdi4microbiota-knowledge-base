# Overview
Aruna Object Storage (AOS) is a modern distributed storage platform designed to meet the increasing demand for effective data management and storage of scientific data. It is the central storage of the Research Data Commons (RDC) cloud layer and the data foundation for the upper layers. It is a cloud-native, scalable system with an API and a S3-compatible interface. It allows resource organization into Objects, Datasets, Collections and Projects. Additionally, it provides an event-driven architecture which enables automation, data validation and improves accessibility and reproducibility of scientific results. AOS is open-source and available at [https://aruna-storage.org](https://aruna-storage.org).
