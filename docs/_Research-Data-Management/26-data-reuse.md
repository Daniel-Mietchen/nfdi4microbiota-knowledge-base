# Benefits

Making data reusable benefits researchers who publish their data, researchers who reuse data, and society. 

Researchers who publish their data see an increase in their scientific reputation, citations and collaborations {% cite rehwald_2022 pauls_2023 %}. In addition, researchers who publish their data not only comply with the [FAIR Data Principles](https://nfdi4microbiota.github.io/nfdi4microbiota-knowledge-base/Research-Data-Management/04-fair), but also avoid bias in the body of evidence {% cite IOM_2015 %}, increase transparency and thus trust in research {% cite engelhardt_2022 rehwald_2022 pauls_2023 %}. Finally, by sharing their resources and perspectives, researchers who publish their data enable other researchers to build on their work, accelerating scientific discovery {% cite engelhardt_2022 IOM_2015 rehwald_2022 %}.

Researchers can recycle unique data by performing secondary analyses to answer new research questions and/or with new methods {% cite rehwald_2022 pauls_2023 %}. Reusing data in this way saves resources such as time, energy and money {% cite engelhardt_2022 FSD rehwald_2022 pauls_2023 %}. Data reuse also increases collaboration and, over time, enables the comparison of different samples {% cite rehwald_2022 pauls_2023 %}. Indeed, data reuse is essential for interdisciplinary experiments and cross-cutting research approaches {% cite pavone_2020 %}.

Making data reusable can also benefit society. It reduces unnecessary experimentation {% cite rehwald_2022 %}, avoids duplication of data collection and minimises collection from hard-to-reach, vulnerable or over-researched populations {% cite FSD rehwald_2022 %}. It also enables replication and thus promotes reproducibility. Finally, it benefits teaching and improves the link between academia and industry {% cite rehwald_2022 %}.

## Common standards for data citation

### Interdisciplinary
* **DataCite 2019**: Creator (PublicationYear): Title. Version. Publisher. (resourceTypeGeneral). Identifier
* **FORCE 11**: Author(s), Year, Data set title, Data repository or archive, Version, Global persistent identifier (preferably as link)
* [BibGuru](https://app.bibguru.com/p/3420f069-22ea-42f6-ba23-4bc6b8ae37e4)
* [DOI Citation Formatter](https://citation.crosscite.org/)

* [How do I cite NCBI services and databases?](https://support.nlm.nih.gov/knowledgebase/article/KA-03391/en-us)

## Code citation
Code citation allows for greater recognition of research software. Some major platforms and tools offer code citation: GitHub, GitLab, JabRef, Zenodo and Zotero {% cite escience_center_2021 %}.

# How-tos

## How to make your data reusable?
* Properly document your data with metadata {% cite pavone_2020 %}.
* Use common metadata standards and terminologies {% cite pavone_2020 %}.
* Standardise your data.
* Share your raw data with an open licence.

## How to maximise already existing data?
