# Benefits

Making data reusable benefits researchers who publish their data, researchers who reuse data, and society. 

Researchers who publish their data see an increase in their scientific reputation, citations and collaborations {% cite rehwald_2022 pauls_2023 %}. In addition, researchers who publish their data not only comply with the [FAIR Data Principles](https://nfdi4microbiota.github.io/nfdi4microbiota-knowledge-base/Research-Data-Management/04-fair), but also avoid bias in the body of evidence {% cite IOM_2015 %}, increase transparency and thus trust in research {% cite engelhardt_2022 rehwald_2022 pauls_2023 %}. Finally, by sharing their resources and perspectives, researchers who publish their data enable other researchers to build on their work, accelerating scientific discovery {% cite engelhardt_2022 IOM_2015 rehwald_2022 %}.

Researchers can recycle unique data by performing secondary analyses to answer new research questions and/or with new methods {% cite rehwald_2022 pauls_2023 %}. Reusing data in this way saves resources such as time, energy and money {% cite engelhardt_2022 FSD rehwald_2022 pauls_2023 %}. Data reuse also increases collaboration and, over time, enables the comparison of different samples {% cite rehwald_2022 pauls_2023 %}. Indeed, data reuse is essential for interdisciplinary experiments and cross-cutting research approaches {% cite pavone_2020 %}.

Making data reusable can also benefit society. It reduces unnecessary experimentation {% cite rehwald_2022 %}, avoids duplication of data collection and minimises collection from hard-to-reach, vulnerable or over-researched populations {% cite FSD rehwald_2022 %}. It also enables replication and thus promotes reproducibility. Finally, it benefits teaching and improves the link between academia and industry {% cite rehwald_2022 %}.
