## Definition of Research Data Management (RDM)
Research Data Management (RDM) is a series of measures that need to be taken during a research project in order to (1) obtain high-quality data (whether produced or reused), (2) make data avaialbe and usable over the long-term and (3) make research findings reproducible beyond the research project {% cite RfII_RD bres_2022 voigt_2022 %}.

## Research data life cycle
The research data life cycle is a model that illustrates the steps of RDM and describes how data should ideally flow through a research project to ensure successful data curation and preservation {% cite NTU_LibGuides_RD_life_cycle bobrov_2021 %}. The research data life cycle can be illustrated as follow:

## Benefits of RDM

Benefits of RDM are numerous, some of them are listed below {% cite assmann_2022 bobrov_2021 bres_2022 engelhardt_2022 jacob_2022 lindstädt_2019 voigt_2022 %}:

* **For researchers**
    * Visibility
    * Reputation (ensures research quality)
    * Data ownership
    * Eligibility for funding
    * Saves time, money and resources
    * Preventing data loss

* **Additional benefits**
    * Helps keep track of the project
    * Helps meet formal and legal requirements
    * Enhances teamwork and collaborations
    * Guarantees transparency, verifiability and reproducibility

## Consequences of poor RDM
Consequences of poor RDM include paper retraction (e.g. [González Amorós & de Puit](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scijus.2015.04.005)).
