# Definition
Digital preservation means taking certain measures to ensure that digital material can be found and rendered in the long term ("long-term accessibility of data"). It aims to preserve information in a way that is understandable and reusable for a specific community and to prove its authenticity. 

# Digital Preservation for Researchers
Best practice methods:
* **Cleaning** data / data structures - see also: Data Organisation
* **Validating** data - see also: Data Quality Control
* **Documenting** data with metadata and context information to ensure reusability: commenting, adding descriptive, administrative and technical metadata, asigning user license.
* **Using well-known open file formats** during the project phase - see below - or transfering data into reusable file formats (needs documenting: original file or derivative)
* **Storing** data following the 3-2-1 rule:
    * Keeping 3 copies of any important file
    * Storing files on 2 different media types
    * Keeping at least 1 copy off site.

## Data selection
To decide well-founded on data selection we recommend reading the how-to guide ["Five steps to decide what data to keep"](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/five-steps-decide-what-data-keep) by Angus Whyte. The suggested steps are:
* **Step 1: Identify purposes** that the data could fulfil: consider the purpose or ‘reuse case’ of your data, including reuse outside your research group.
* **Step 2:** Identify data that **must** be kept: consider legal or policy compliance risks, as well as funder requirements. 
* **Step 3:** Identify data that **should** be kept: as it may have long-term value. 
* **Step 4: Weigh up the costs** and identify any need for external advice in case of shortfall in the budget. 
* **Step 5: Complete the data appraisal**, i.e. list what data must, should or could be kept to fulfil which potential reuse purposes. Summarise any actions needed to prepare the data for deposit - or justification for not keeping it.


## Recommended file formats for preservation
It is recommended making your data available in recommended file formats additional to the original software format.
Attributes of those file formats are: 
* Open rather than proprietary
* Exportable to / unpackable into an open format (e.g. xlsx, docx, etc. can be unpacked into folders of xml files)
* Machine-readable
* Well-documented
* In widespread use
* Simple (e.g. csv rather than xlsx)
* Text-based (i.e. any file you can open with a text editor and read) rather than binary (e.g. txt files rather than doc files)

For biomaterial data, recommended formats are CSV, TXT and XML.
