# Metadata

## What is metadata? 

Before we delve into specifications on what Metadata standards for the Microbiology community are or would be, let us explain what metadata is and how you probably already used it at least once in your life. 

In the simplest terms, metadata is **data** about data. So in general, metadata provides us with information about other data, but does not tell us anything about the content of the data itself. 

For example: When you use your smartphone camera to take photos of your loved one, your device automatically creates the corresponding metadata regarding that photograph. The metadata in this case encapsulates:
1. Name of file
2. Type of file
3. Size of file
4. Creation date of file
5. Width of photograph
6. Height of photograph
