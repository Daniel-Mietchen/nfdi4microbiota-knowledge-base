# Metadata

## What is metadata? 

Before we delve into specifications on what Metadata standards for the Microbiology community are or would be, let us explain what metadata is and how you probably already used it at least once in your life. 

In the simplest terms, metadata is **data** about data. So in general, metadata provides us with information about other data, but does not tell us anything about the content of the data itself. 

For example: When you use your smartphone camera to take photos of your loved one, your device automatically creates the corresponding metadata regarding that photograph. The metadata in this case encapsulates:
1. Name of file
2. Type of file
3. Size of file
4. Creation date of file
5. Width of photograph
6. Height of photograph

# Metadata standards

Once a community agrees to a set of relevant metadata for their field, they can devise metadata standards.
A metadata standard is usually defined for a given type of data and by different stakeholders (e.g., users community, data repositories).
For every metadata fields part of a metadata standard, one could expect a human-readable description of the metadata field paired with a machine-readable persistent identifier of the field, then an indication of the level of requirements of this field in the standard and how many values of this field are expected (that is the cardinality).


[More than a thousand standards are listed by the organisation `FAIRsharing.org`](https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard) which can be overwhelming.
We compiled a [list of widely used metadata standards in the fied of microbiome research](https://github.com/NFDI4Microbiota/MetadataStandards)
