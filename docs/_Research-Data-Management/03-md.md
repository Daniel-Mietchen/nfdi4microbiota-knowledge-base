# Metadata

## What is metadata? 

Before we delve into specifications on what Metadata standards for the Microbiology community are or would be, let us explain what metadata is and how you probably already used it at least once in your life. 

In the simplest terms, metadata is **data** about data. So in general, metadata provides us with information about other data, but does not tell us anything about the content of the data itself.
